2025-04-20 22:32:54,"A little poem from the book the Philosophy of bitcoin I stumbled upon this poem while reading *The Philosophy of Bitcoin* by Alvaro Di Maria, I thought I'd share it with y'all. Originally written by the Spanish satirist Francisco de Quevedo in the 17th century, it paints a vivid and ironic portrait of money as the true ruler of society, mockingly referred to as the ""Lord of Dollars."" In the poem, money wields power over kings, priests, and scholars, corrupts justice, seduces virtue, and elevates fools, all while commanding global reverence. What really hit me was how seamlessly this centuries-old critique of wealth and power fits into today's world. In the context of Bitcoin, the poem takes on new life. It highlights how our current financial system, driven by fiat currency and central control, continues to concentrate power and manipulate value. Quevedo‚Äôs words, reframed through the lens of Bitcoin, underline the urgent need for an alternative, a monetary system rooted in transparency, decentralization, and individual sovereignty.

I must says I like it, reminds me of the literature I used to read back in high school from the humanism/renaissance/enlightenment writters about money. The way Quevedo personifies money as a corrupting force feels right at home alongside Erasmus, Montaigne, Voltaire, or even Rousseau. It‚Äôs kind of beautiful, really, like the old ideals of liberty, reason, and dignity merging with the tools of a digital age.

""For a trifle more or less

All his power will confess,

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

\[‚Ä¶\]

And the ugliest at his side

Shines with all of beauty‚Äôs pride;

Over kings and priests awl scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

He‚Äôs a gallant, he‚Äôs a winner,

Black or white be his complexion;

He is brave without correction

As a Moor or Christian sinner.

He makes cross and medal bright,

And he smashes laws of right,‚Äî

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Noble are his proud ancestors

For his blood-veins are patrician;

Royalties make the position

Of his Orient investors;

So they find themselves preferred

To the duke or country herd,‚Äî

Over kings and priests and scholars,

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars!

Of his standing who can question

When there yields unto his rank, a

Hight-Castillian Do√±a Blanca,

If you follow the suggestion?‚Äî

He that crowns the lowest stool,

And to hero turns the fool,‚Äî

Over kings and priests and scholars,

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

On his shields are noble bearings;

His emblazonments unfurling

Show his arms of royal sterling

All his high pretensions airing;

And the credit of his miner

Stands behind the proud refiner,

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Contracts, bonds, and bills to render,

Like his counsels most excelling,

Are esteemed within the dwelling

Of the banker and the lender.

So is prudence overthrown,

And the judge complaisant grown,‚Äî

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Such indeed his sovereign standing

(With some discount in the order),

Spite the tax, the cash-recorder

Still his value fixed is branding.

He keeps rank significant

To the prince or finn in want,‚Äî

Over kings and Priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Never meets he dames ungracious

To his smiles or his attention,

How they glow but at the mention

Of his promises capacious!

And how bare-faced they become

To the coin beneath his thumb

Over kings and Priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Mightier in peaceful season

(And in this his wisdom showeth)

Are his standards, than when bloweth

War his haughty blasts and breeze on;

In all foreign lands at home,

Equal e‚Äôen in pauper‚Äôs loam,‚Äî

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.""

I sheepishly employed the go-to AI tool to draft the thesis below. I hope others will be easy on me as I rarely post anything other than memes and mainly agree with others here. I have great interest in our favorite stonk and Bitcoin, and I wanted to dive into the deeper conversation where the two may meet in the shadows.

This thesis is my attempt to weave together the breadcrumbs‚Äîfrom GameStop to Bitcoin, from Reddit sleuths to sovereign finance, and from shadow swaps to strategic reserves. It‚Äôs speculative, yes‚Äîbut grounded in patterns we‚Äôve all been tracking. I‚Äôd love your feedback, critiques, corrections, or expansions. Tear it apart or build on it‚Äîeither way, let‚Äôs keep digging.

Stack sats and power to the players. üöÄüß†üí•

**Abstract:**¬†This thesis examines the transformative impact of Bitcoin and decentralized financial technologies on the global financial system. It explores the role of the United States government in the strategic adoption of Bitcoin, deregulation efforts, and the potential implications on monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and geopolitical power structures. Drawing from real-world case studies, quantitative data, and emerging theories, including insights from the book¬†*Softwar*, Reddit analysis by Carpetman8900 and related contributors, and recent content by Peruvian Bull, this work investigates how digital assets are reshaping both macroeconomic policy and international relations.

**Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset**

The U.S. government has historically relied on fiat instruments like U.S. Treasuries to maintain economic dominance. However, with rising debt, inflation, and geopolitical tensions threatening the dollar's reserve status, Bitcoin is increasingly considered as a strategic hedge.

*Quantitative Analysis:*¬†Bitcoin's scarcity (21 million cap), increasing institutional adoption, and network effect are compared against gold and sovereign bonds in volatility-adjusted terms. Case studies from El Salvador and MicroStrategy are presented as examples of Bitcoin's institutional utility.

*Criticism:*¬†Critics argue Bitcoin is too volatile, environmentally harmful due to proof-of-work mining, and potentially subject to manipulation by whales or large holders. Traditional economists cite a lack of yield and long-term valuation models.

*Rebuttal:*¬†Volatility is decreasing as adoption grows. Technological solutions (e.g., Lightning Network) and custodial innovations (e.g., multisig wallets) improve usability and security. As for environmental concerns, Bitcoin mining increasingly utilizes renewable energy sources.

**Cryptocurrency Deregulation and Shifting Financial Power**

Cryptocurrency deregulation in the U.S. is not a sign of decentralization's surrender, but a strategic maneuver. Deregulation can enable the government to participate in and shape the crypto economy without direct control, creating new revenue streams and increasing its influence on global digital finance norms.

*Evidence:*¬†Review of recent regulatory bills (e.g., FIT21), SEC decisions, and institutional lobbying efforts by firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Coinbase.

*Criticism:*¬†Deregulation may signal a backdoor for legacy financial institutions to absorb, tame, and redirect the ethos of decentralized finance. Some also claim it opens the door to unchecked speculation, rug pulls, and crypto-centric financial crises.

*Rebuttal:*¬†Regulation-by-enforcement has already failed to prevent manipulation. A well-defined legal framework can enhance trust while preserving decentralization. Strategic regulation can mitigate risks while retaining open-source innovation.

**GameStop and Systemic Fragility in Financial Markets**

The GameStop short squeeze highlighted vulnerabilities in traditional financial markets, particularly surrounding short hedge funds (SHFs), synthetic shares, and opaque derivatives like total return swaps.

*Case Study:*¬†Melvin Capital's collapse and Citadel‚Äôs emergency intervention.

*Analysis:*¬†The event exposed the fragile underpinnings of the financial system, where excessive leverage and lack of transparency create systemic risk. The 4/18 Reddit post by Carpetman8900 outlines how SHFs leveraged hidden positions and swaps to obscure losses.

*Connection to Crypto:*¬†These issues mirror criticisms of centralized finance that Bitcoin aims to solve: transparency via public ledgers, peer-to-peer settlements, and immutable contracts.

*Criticism:*¬†Critics claim that GameStop was a one-off incident driven by online hysteria and coordinated ‚Äúmob investing,‚Äù not systemic failure.

*Counter:*¬†The GME event parallels similar systemic failures (e.g., Archegos, 2008 crisis) rooted in excessive leverage, synthetic exposure, and lack of transparency. The Reddit investigation reveals how this is still ongoing.

**Bitcoin and the De-Dollarization Movement**

With the BRICS nations and others seeking to bypass the U.S. dollar in global trade, Bitcoin offers an alternative settlement mechanism that is neutral, borderless, and resistant to censorship.

*Data Points:*¬†Growing adoption in sanctioned or inflation-stricken nations (e.g., Turkey, Nigeria, Russia), and moves by countries to hold Bitcoin in reserves (e.g., reports of sovereign purchases).

*Criticism:*¬†Critics argue Bitcoin lacks legal clarity, sufficient liquidity for trade, and is vulnerable to speculative bubbles. Governments might adopt CBDCs instead of decentralized alternatives.

*Rebuttal:*¬†Early adoption curves show Bitcoin functions similarly to the internet in the 1990s. Volatility is a natural byproduct of price discovery in emerging assets. Liquidity is increasing via institutional infrastructure.

**Liquidity Air Pocket Theory and Global Financial Risks**

The Liquidity Air Pocket theory posits that during crises, the illusion of liquidity evaporates. Central banks may find themselves unable to provide liquidity without causing hyperinflation. Bitcoin, as a non-correlated, decentralized asset, could offer a lifeline.

*Softwar Insights:*¬†Author Jason Lowery posits that Bitcoin is not merely money, but a new form of ""software-based warfare"" in which digital energy and proof-of-work networks can secure information, property, and economic activity from coercive states.

*Discussion:*¬†Bitcoin, as a non-kinetic strategic asset, may offer sovereigns a new toolkit in financial warfare.

*Criticism:*¬†Economists argue that Bitcoin is too niche, immature, and lacks the institutional infrastructure needed to act as a reliable backstop. Its energy consumption and technical complexity further reduce viability.

*Counterpoint:*¬†Bitcoin's development pace, rising institutional backing, and reduced counterparty risk make it a serious long-term contender. The Liquidity Air Pocket theory, when cross-examined with central bank balance sheet inflation, supports diversification.

**Technological Advancements and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

As central banks push forward with CBDCs, the juxtaposition with decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin becomes central to global financial power dynamics. Where CBDCs offer programmable money with surveillance capabilities, Bitcoin offers privacy, permissionless innovation, and borderless functionality.

*Comparison:*¬†China's e-CNY rollout vs. Bitcoin Lightning Network adoption in emerging markets.

*Criticism:*¬†CBDCs are viewed as threats to privacy and may be used to limit dissent or automate economic control. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is criticized for being slow, inefficient at scale, and too libertarian in ethos.

*Discussion:*¬†Which vision wins‚Äîstate-controlled digital fiat or decentralized digital freedom‚Äîmay define the 21st-century economic order. A hybrid system where Bitcoin complements CBDCs may emerge.

¬†

**Discussion Questions and Educational Rebuttals**

1. **Can Bitcoin realistically serve as a reserve asset for the U.S. government?**
   * *Answer:*¬†Yes, due to its finite supply and increasing institutional adoption.
   * *Rebuttal:*¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility undermines its use.
   * *Counter:*¬†As adoption increases, volatility historically decreases. ETFs and futures markets add stability.
2. **Does deregulation signal control or surrender to decentralized finance?**
   * *Answer:*¬†It‚Äôs a control mechanism via integration and taxation.
   * *Rebuttal:*¬†It empowers bad actors.
   * *Counter:*¬†Decentralized tools can audit and prevent fraud better than traditional systems.
3. **What does GameStop tell us about the current state of financial markets?**
   * *Answer:*¬†It reveals the fragility and opacity of traditional finance.
   * *Rebuttal:*¬†It was a unique event.
   * *Counter:*¬†Similar anomalies (Archegos, Credit Suisse) indicate broader systemic risks.
4. **Will CBDCs replace or coexist with cryptocurrencies?**
   * *Answer:*¬†They will likely coexist.
   * *Rebuttal:*¬†Governments won‚Äôt tolerate competition.
   * *Counter:*¬†CBDCs are complementary for policy, Bitcoin for store of value.

**Conclusion:**¬†This thesis presents a compelling case for the transformative potential of Bitcoin and decentralized finance. It challenges traditional monetary models, explores evolving geopolitical strategies, and offers a forward-looking perspective on how digital assets may redefine global financial order. As the lines blur between state power and digital autonomy, understanding these technologies is not only prudent‚Äîit is essential.

2025-04-19 16:27:30,"A Modest Proposal for Civic Yield: Turning Drained Communities into Capital Nodes If you‚Äôre running a Lightning node, you already know: it‚Äôs not just where value flows that matters‚Äîit‚Äôs where it leaves and never returns.

Redlining was the first choke point. Operation Chokepoint was just the sequel. Entire zip codes have been economically air-gapped, not because they‚Äôre unproductive, but because the financial system treats them as high-risk by default and low-return by design.

So here‚Äôs the modest proposal:
Turn those regions into sovereign capital nodes.

Enter Civic Yield Instruments‚Äîa suite of counter-cyclical financial tools designed to intentionally flood economically starved areas with capital during downturns, and let them retain autonomy during upswings.

Not through charity.
Not through trickle-down ‚Äúinvestment zones.‚Äù
But through financial rights infrastructure:

The Civic Yield Stack:

	‚Ä¢	Civic Notes ‚Äì inflation-resistant, tax-advantaged bonds to fund local credit unions, community banks, and digital infrastructure

	‚Ä¢	Resilience Contracts ‚Äì smart derivatives that activate when unemployment spikes or local GDP contracts

	‚Ä¢	Stress Swaps ‚Äì synthetic insurance products that payout during economic trauma (housing crashes, credit freezes, systemic failures)

	‚Ä¢	Recovery Warrants ‚Äì yield-bearing tokens that reward actual recovery benchmarks (employment, housing, education)

All managed locally. All opt-in.
Auditable, modular, and open-source.

Think of it like a Lightning node for community capital: a system that routes liquidity to where it‚Äôs needed, when it‚Äôs needed, without waiting for policy handouts or Wall Street‚Äôs blessing.

The U.S. government once issued Liberty Bonds to fight foreign wars. Maybe it‚Äôs time for Civic Yield to fund the war at home‚Äînot a ‚ÄúWar on Poverty‚Äù that morphs into a war on the poor, but a quiet insurgency of capital reclamation.

I'm targeting \~8th grade reading level and age and no prior knowledge of Bitcoin. The below is a section that's meant to explain why big money may flow from other assets into Bitcoin in the future. All feedback welcome!*

# Goodbye real estate, hello Bitcoin

In 2017, a man named Didi Taihuttu from the Netherlands made headlines in the Bitcoin community. He sold most of his family‚Äôs belongings and used the money to buy Bitcoin. Then he, his wife, and their three young daughters went traveling for three years.

I‚Äôm not telling you to do the same thing. I‚Äôm definitely not saying you should sell everything you own, buy Bitcoin, and live out of a van.

But it‚Äôs interesting that Didi sold the family‚Äôs home. He could have played it safe and kept the house. That way, they‚Äôd always have a place to come back to, no matter what happened.

Still, we can understand why he sold it. Owning real estate can be a hassle. There‚Äôs always something to fix‚Äîplumbing problems, gardening, tree issues, and more. On top of that, you have to pay property taxes, insurance, and utility bills.

And if you have renters, that‚Äôs a lot of other problems. Sure, you get rental income. But you also have to worry about how they take care of your property and handle their demands for upgrades. And what if they don‚Äôt pay their rent?

Bitcoin is much simpler. Once you‚Äôve bought it and set up your savings plan, it runs on its own. There are no repairs, no tenants, and no surprise bills. So it makes sense that Didi sold his real estate along with everything else before traveling.

So, how did things work out for Didi and his family?

He sold his house for 100 Bitcoin in 2017. At the time, the house was worth about $300,000. That means Bitcoin was around $3,000. He said he would hold onto the family‚Äôs Bitcoin for at least three years.

In 2020, the price of Bitcoin ranged from about $5,000 to $29,000.

If we split the difference just to guess, that‚Äôs about $17,000 per Bitcoin. So, if he still had all 100 Bitcoin, that‚Äôd be about $1.7 million. That‚Äôs a big jump from the initial $300,000 value of his family‚Äôs house when he sold it.

I‚Äôm not telling you to sell your home. Or to give up on the dream of owning one. There are great reasons to own a home. And for some people, real estate investing works really well.

What I‚Äôm saying is: Look at different points of view. Think about what really fits your goals and your comfort level. And don‚Äôt overlook the power and simplicity that Bitcoin gives you.

Let‚Äôs also look at how Bitcoin and real estate can go hand-in-hand.

Remember my good friend Henry from Chapter 1? He‚Äôs been investing in real estate for decades. He owns several rental properties that bring in steady cash each month. For Henry, real estate is part of the legacy he wants to leave behind. His goal is to pass down at least one property to each of his three daughters.

Not long ago, I joined Henry on a ride-along to check out some of his properties. We were talking about Bitcoin‚Äîhow he sees it, and how he‚Äôd recently sold some for a nice profit. He used that money to buy a tiny home and add it to one of his properties. Then he rented it out to a college student.

Now Henry has extra income coming in every month. What can Henry do with that extra income? Well, anything he wants to. But maybe he‚Äôll buy more Bitcoin!

Now let‚Äôs look at other places where people keep their wealth. Just like real estate, some of these might fade as more people start choosing Bitcoin instead‚Ä¶

**Goodbye stocks and bonds**

For decades, stocks and bonds have been popular ways to grow wealth.

Stocks are like owning a tiny piece of a company. If the company does well, your investment goes up in value. This is one of the most familiar ways to build wealth, especially for older generations. Boomers made big gains investing in companies like Microsoft and McDonald‚Äôs. Later, Gen Xers and Millennials saw success with stocks like Apple and Amazon.

Bonds are like a loan. You lend money to a company or the government, and in return, they promise to pay you interest over time. Bonds are usually seen as safer than stocks, but they grow more slowly.

Both markets are massive. As of 2024, the U.S. stock market is worth about $46 trillion, and the bond market is even bigger‚Äîaround $51 trillion.

But some investors are saying goodbye to stocks and bonds and hello to Bitcoin. People who watch the markets are noticing that Bitcoin has done much better than these traditional savings tools.

In terms of long-term gains, bonds don‚Äôt really compare to Bitcoin. They‚Äôre meant to be low risk, and their returns reflect that‚Äîusually around 4.5% a year or even less.

But what about stocks, which are known for being more exciting and offering bigger potential gains?

While I was writing this in 2025, a major investment firm called VanEck released a report on Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. They showed that Bitcoin outperformed the NASDAQ‚Äîthe second-largest stock exchange in the world‚Äîacross every time frame they looked at.

I decided to double-check their findings and add one more comparison: the S&P 500, one of the most widely followed stock indexes in the U.S.:

|Time Frame|S&P 500 gain|NASDAQ gain|Bitcoin gain|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 week|\-9.79%|\-9.80%|\-4.04%|
|1 month|\-0.23%|\-14.25%|\-8.15%|
|Year-to-Date|\-13.93%|\-19.20%|\-16.23%|
|1 Year|1.00%|\-2.38%|13.89%|
|2 Years|24.08%|28.98%|183.04%|
|3 Years|14.12%|13.47%|81.69%|
|5 Years|88.33%|82.12%|998.71%|
|10 Years|143.12%|214.36%|30,995.34%|

^(Bitcoin compared to stock market indicators for different time frames. As of April 2025.)

As you can see from the numbers, Bitcoin has outperformed the stock market overall. It came out ahead in almost every comparison, and completely dominated the longer time frames.

With a track record like that, it‚Äôs no surprise if diligent savers choose to put less into the traditional market‚Ä¶ and more into Bitcoin.

**Goodbye gold and silver**

People often turn to gold and silver‚Äîso-called ‚Äúprecious metals‚Äù‚Äîas a way to protect their purchasing power. These metals have a long track record of holding value, especially during times of inflation or economic uncertainty.

But over time, Bitcoin has done far better.

From 2015 to 2025, gold climbed from around $1,150 an ounce to about $3,300‚Äîa solid 100%+ gain. Not bad. But compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs explosive growth over the same period, it‚Äôs not even close.

Some analysts who pay attention to this kind of thing believe Bitcoin is already eating into gold‚Äôs market share.

More and more people now see Bitcoin as a better, more modern alternative to traditional metals. It offers the same kind of savings power‚Äîbut in a digital form that‚Äôs more powerful, more portable, and way more flexible.

Goodbye CDs

Certificates of deposit, or CDs, are a classic way to save money at a bank. You lock up your money for a set period‚Äîlike 1 or 5 years‚Äîand when it‚Äôs done, the bank pays you a bit of interest. It‚Äôs kind of like a savings account, except you can‚Äôt touch the money until the time‚Äôs up or you‚Äôll get hit with a penalty.

CDs are popular because they‚Äôre safe‚Äîyour money won‚Äôt vanish, and you know exactly what you‚Äôll get back. As of 2024, there‚Äôs about $9.6 trillion in CDs in the U.S., according to banking data.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not saying the world should give safe, reliable savings tools like CDs.

But as we saw in Chapter 2, a simple Bitcoin savings strategy has done much better than CDs. Bitcoin beats inflation way better than CDs. And while CDs often require you to lock up $500 or more, you can start with Bitcoin for just a few bucks‚Äîsomething we‚Äôve talked about throughout this book.



***I once heard someone say Bitcoin is the greatest savings account ever. Didn‚Äôt know much about it then. Now I‚Äôm part of it... watching history prove it.***

***‚Äì Scottie Pippen, NBA superstar and Bitcoin advocate, February 18, 2025***



**Goodbye collectibles**

Collectibles‚Äîlike rare cards, coins, art, or vintage toys‚Äîare things people buy hoping they‚Äôll be worth more someday. A lot of people love collectibles as long-term investments because they‚Äôre fun to own and sometimes can increase significantly in value.¬†

The U.S. collectibles market was about $500 billion in 2024, with around $65 billion of that in art, according to auction house data.

But collectibles come with risk. Prices can swing wildly, and it‚Äôs tough to know which items will actually gain value. It can also be hard to find something at the price you want‚Äîor to find a buyer when you‚Äôre ready to sell.

But with Bitcoin, you can buy ‚Äì and sell ‚Äì as much or as little as you want, whenever you want.

And the statistics say that what has happened over the last 55 years, since the debt snowball accelerated in the 1970s, it will continue well into the future, as this gigantic debt snowball continues to grow and speed-up in momentum. 

At this point, it would take a miracle from God Himself to reverse the coming economic catastrophe, as no human or group individually anywhere on this planet has the ability to stop it.

Lacking group consensus and determined will, which is not there, I no longer believe this global economic situation is salvageable without extreme harm to everyone. 

And so, judging by past government actions and decisions, and projecting what has been to what will be, the odds favor an acceleration of money printing and inflation.

There's also a saying: ""when all else fails, they take you to WAR.""

The crumbling global economic mess is creating a lot of war mongering trigger-happy politicians who are, right now,  increasing military spending and building up reserves of troops and munitions.

So not only will they destroy the economy, but they are adamant at distracting us with a tangent; once the wars begin, we'll forget all about the financial problems. 

Needless to say, I would appreciate if this reality doesn't come to fruition, and I would willingly take a cut in my Bitcoin investments to be proven wrong.
